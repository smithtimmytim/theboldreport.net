Some of you may have heard of [Manton Reece's Indie Microblogging Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/manton/indie-microblogging-owning-your-short-form-writing). If you haven't, check it out. We need to start moving away from Twitter, people; it's mostly toxic waste. I emailed Manton to ask if his microblogging service will work with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). He responded with a resounding yes, and a link to what he defines as a microblog:

> From my perspective, a microblog post has these qualities:
>
> - Must have an RSS feed.
> - Does not have an RSS item title.
> - Contains short post text, 280 characters or less.

That's easy enough. I'm getting ready for my Twitter exit.
