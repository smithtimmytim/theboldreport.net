Kwame Opam on *The Verge*:

>To promote the upcoming X-men: Days of Future Past, a new viral site takes the 50th anniversary of JFK's murder and spins a new conspiracy theory out of the historic tragedy.

Some will say this is wrong, but it's quite an interesting twist on actual history, and an intriguing way to promote a movie.
