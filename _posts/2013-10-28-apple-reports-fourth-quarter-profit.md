Jim Dalrymple on *The Loop*:

>Apple on Monday reported its fourth quarter results, posting revenue of $37.5 billion and a profit of $7.5 billion. This compares to revenue of $36 billion and net profit of $8.2 billion in the year-ago quarter.

I love Apple, but the amount of success they have is sickening at times. This is a stupid amount of money.
