I recently recorded [an episode of *Retake* about *Rogue One*][0178-0001]. At the end of the episode, TJ and I started talking about where the movie fell within our personal favorites list. I realized I don't have this list written down somewhere.

You'll notice that certain *Star Wars* movies are missing. I love this franchise, so I have good things to say about all the movies, but some just didn't belong here. I'm sure you'll understand. Here's my list:

1. ***[The Empire Strikes Back][0178-0002]***  
This should go without saying. *The Empire Strikes Back* is *Star Wars* in all of its glory. The film is written very well, Vader has his best lines, and John Williams adds the iconic "Imperial March" to the list of *Star Wars* themes.
2. ***[The Force Awakens][0178-0003]***  
The opening line of this movie is literally, "This will begin to make things right." Hell yea it did! After years of mostly-terrible *Star Wars* movies, this one made me excited about the franchise once again.
3. ***[Rogue One][0178-0004]***  
The first of many (I hope) spin-off movies that explore other parts of the *Star Wars* universe. [The film has its flaws][0178-0005], but still a great *Star Wars* film.
4. ***[A New Hope][0178-0006]***  
I didn't plan it this way, but right now *A New Hope* is fourth on my list. I love this movie, but you can tell it didn't understand how big it would be.

This list will obviously change as more movies come out. What about you? [Send me an email](mailto:tim@theboldreport.net) with your thoughts.
