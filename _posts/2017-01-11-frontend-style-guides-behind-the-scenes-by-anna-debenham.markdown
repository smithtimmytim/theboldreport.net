Anna Debenham:

> Last week, I published a new version of my book, Front-end Style Guides. A lot of work went into it over several years, and I thought it would be worth writing about that, and my experience with self-publishing.

*Love* behind-the-scenes posts. Turns out that making an `.ePub` is a big pain.
