Jon Stewart:

> It’s very difficult to say we want the legacy to be “It was the funniest show in television history,” but you want it to be appreciated for what I think it was: consistently funny, consistently smart over a long period of time. I felt like we never took the opportunity for granted.

What a great interview. Jon talks about his new film, the news, and the legacy of *The Daily Show*.
