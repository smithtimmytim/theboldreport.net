Marco Arment:

> The app market is becoming a mature, developed industry, with vastly increased commoditization compared to its early days. Competition is ubiquitous, relentless, and often shameless, even in categories that were previously under-the-radar niches. Standing out requires more effort than ever, yet profits are harder to come by than ever.

The struggle of the indie developer is real. It all points to the burst of a bubble we've been enjoying the past few of years. I for one, hope those of us who work hard to create quality work can survive the impact.
