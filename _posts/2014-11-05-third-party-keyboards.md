Steven Aquino for *MacStories*:

> The second problem with Apple's implementation of third-party keyboards is they don't have all the bells and whistles that the system keyboard does. To wit: no access to dictation or autocorrect; neither do they have access to the tap-and-hold-the-globe-button gesture to switch between keyboards. As well, switching from a light to dark keyboard for day/night, and using the `UIKit` blur effect is also disallowed by Apple.

> All in all, the limitations that Apple imposes on developers rolling their own keyboards make them less attractive to customers.

Fascinating article. I hope Apple loosens its grip on the keyboards. Till then, developers can't make the experience users truly want.
