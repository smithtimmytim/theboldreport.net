Uncle Dave:

>Abiding in “light frames, great content” means I’m not limited by an arbitrary number of kilobytes. Some content needs to be bigger, commented, zoomed-in on, animated, felt, sung, interacted with, played. It’s not a zealous adherence to metrics, but a single question: “Does the content justify the kilobytes?”

I love this. Instead of being dogmatic about rules, we do what's best by the content and those who visit the sites we build.
