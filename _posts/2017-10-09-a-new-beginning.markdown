I've moved. Moved to a new name and domain. The new name of my blog is *Brightly Colored*. I go into a little bit more detail [in this post](https://brightlycolored.org/2017/10/a-new-beginning/).

Since it would seem I don't have the hang of this "web" stuff, I didn't redirect the feeds properly and nowâ€¦ you'll have to resubscribe.

## Subscription Options
If you were subscribed via Twitter or the Email newsletter **you don't need to resubscribe**. Those I was able to redirect. Just like before, you have four options:


### Master Feed

This gets you everything. Links and articles.<br>
<https://feedpress.me/brightlycolored>

### Articles-Only Feed

The feed with only long form articles.<br>
<https://feedpress.me/brightlycolored-articles>

### Twitter

[Follow Brightly Colored on Twitter](https://twitter.com/brightlycolord).

### Email Newsletter

Visit [the Subscribe page](https://brightlycolored.org/subscribe/) on *Brightly Colored*.

## Thank You!
It's been a wonderful four years of *The Bold Report* and I appreciate all your support and for reading. Hope to see you on the new site!
