Chris Gonzales on *The Sweet Setup*:

> Back in early July (2016), Australian designer and developer Matthew Palmer released Rocket, a Mac app that gives you Slack-style emoji autocomplete everywhere you type on your Mac. It’s as simple as it sounds, and free to download. (It also feels like something that should be a default part of OS X/macOS. Maybe someday!)

Once Slack introduced this simple way to write emoji in their app, I know I’ve been wishing it’d be available everywhere. My wish has come true.
