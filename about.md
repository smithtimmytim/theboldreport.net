*The Bold Report* is designed and developed by me, [Tim Smith](http://ttimsmith.com), in beautiful St. Paul, Minnesota. This publication covers a whole range of things including, but not limited to: design, development, technology, Geek culture, and Apple.

## How It's Made

Most writing is done on my Macbook Pro in [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer). I also write and publish from iOS in [Editorial](http://omz-software.com/editorial/). If you'd like to learn how I do that, [I wrote about it](/2016/01/publishing-to-jekyll-from-ios/).

The site is designed and developed in [Atom](https://atom.io/), with the exception of the logo. That was done in Adobe Illustrator. I won't link to that one because if you've never heard of it, you've probably lived a better life. It's all hosted by [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), and powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). If you're wondering how to do that, [I wrote about how to deploy a Jekyll site to Heroku](/2015/06/hosting-a-jekyll-site-on-heroku/) too.
