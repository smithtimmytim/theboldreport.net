Thank you for your interest in supporting *The Bold Report*! There are a couple of ways you can do this.

## Sponsorship
This is the perfect place to promote your product, or service to smart people interested in design, development, technology, Apple, geek culture, and more.

### The Syndicate

Sponsorships are booked via [The Syndicate](http://syndicateads.net/) network. These are weekly exclusive sponsorships that run from Monday through Sunday. If you'd like to see an example, [here's one I did for the Theme Foundry](/2013/10/sponsor-the-theme-foundry/).

#### Why The Syndicate

- Over 90,000 subscribers.

- 1.6 million monthly webpage views.

- Your product, service, or company is promoted on each network site throughout the week of your sponsorship.

### Fusion Ads
The sidebar ad is powered by the [Fusion Ad Network](http://fusionads.net). Advertising with Fusion allows you to promote your product, service, or company on sites similar to this one. I've discovered quite a few products and services that I now use frequently, through Fusion.
